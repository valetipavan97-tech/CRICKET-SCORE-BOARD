Cricket Score Board – C Programming Project

📌 Project Title

Cricket Score Board System

🎯 Objective

To develop a structured scoreboard program in C that tracks and displays cricket match details including runs, wickets, overs, and player statistics.

📝 Description

This project implements a cricket scoreboard using a structure-based approach in C. It stores data for players such as name, role, runs, balls faced, wickets, overs bowled, and runs conceded. The scoreboard displays real-time updates for batsmen and bowlers separately. Team data is maintained using arrays of structures, and the scoreboard output is formatted clearly for better readability.
